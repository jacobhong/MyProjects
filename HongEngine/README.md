I made some modifications to a game engine provided from the book Beginning Android Games(2nd edition). Took out some features I don't need and removed support for lower apis. Started to recreate the snake game for tablets with my own graphics and sounds but has none of the screens the main game has. Might add more to it after finishing the book.
