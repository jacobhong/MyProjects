I made some modifications to a game engine provided from the book Beginning Android Games(2nd edition). Took out some features I don't need and removed support for lower apis. After making the snake game given in the book I wanted to change the pictures and sounds, but didn't put much effort into the art, just wanted to see a quick change in the game.
